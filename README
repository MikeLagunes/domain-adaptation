## Setup

1. Install uv: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
2. Install dependencies: `uv sync`


# Models Package

This directory contains modified torchvision models for domain adaptation research.

## Structure
So far it contains a collection of convnets and transformer models for image classification. 


- `maxvit.py` - MaxViT (Multi-Axis Vision Transformer) implementation
- `resnet.py` - ResNet and variants (ResNeXt, Wide ResNet) implementation
- `convnext.py` - ConvNeXt implementation
- `torchvision_utils.py` - Minimal utilities extracted from torchvision internals
- `TORCHVISION_LICENSE` - BSD 3-Clause license for borrowed code

## Usage

```python
from models import resnet50, convnext_tiny, maxvit_t

# Create models without pretrained weights (for modification)
model1 = resnet50(weights=None)
model2 = convnext_tiny(weights=None)
model3 = maxvit_t(weights=None)

# Or use pretrained weights
from models import ResNet50_Weights, ConvNeXt_Tiny_Weights, MaxVit_T_Weights

model1 = resnet50(weights=ResNet50_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V2)
model2 = convnext_tiny(weights=ConvNeXt_Tiny_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1)
model3 = maxvit_t(weights=MaxVit_T_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1)
```

## Why Copy Instead of Import?

These files were copied from torchvision to:
1. Enable modifications for domain adaptation research
2. Avoid dependency on torchvision internal APIs (which can change)
3. Keep custom modifications version-controlled with your project
4. Allow architectural changes without monkey-patching
